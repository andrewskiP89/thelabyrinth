This code was written for personal usage to practice with the OpenGL libray. The progam allows to move the camera between some walls, which are illuminated by a rotating light. As a lightning model, a simple phong model has been implemented.

TODO list includes:

- Avoiding draw the same vertex multiple times.
- Adding a logic to generate random terrains and frustum culling logic.
- Using a skybox to encompass the scene.
- Add gravity to che camera
- Manage collisions
